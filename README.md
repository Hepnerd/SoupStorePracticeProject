# Welcome to the soup store practice project. 

The code was written to show basic skills in the ASP.net framework. This was written on a Monday night and is quite messy/not correct code practices (No comments, orphaned code, etc).

When the user is logged in, they will be able to add products to their cart and clear the cart entirely. Products can also be created.
